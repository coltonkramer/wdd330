        Anything created in the global scope are properties of the global object
        in JavaScript and any functions are methods of it. The browser Object
        Model is a collection of properties and methods that contain information
        about the browser and computer screen. Every browser window, tab, popup,
        frame, and iframe has an object window. The window object has a number
        of properties and methods the provide information about the user’s
        browser. Such as: <br />
        <br />
        window.navigator:<br />
        returns informations about the browser that is being used<br /><br />
        window.location:<br />
        contains info about the url and what the page contains<br /><br />
        window.history:<br />
        Used to access info about and previously visited pages in the current
        browser session. You can get the width and height of the display itself
        with window.screen.height/width and the window size with
        availWidth/Height Cookies are small files that are saved locally on a
        users computer. They were invented by Netscape as a way of getting round
        HTTP being a stateless protocol

        The data- attribute is a way of embedding data in a web page using
        custom attributes that are ignored by the browser. HTML5 web storage
        provides a key-value store on the client’s computer that is similar to
        using cookies but fewer restrictions, more capacity, and is generally
        easier to use. Web storage has critical differences from cookies.<br /> • Info
        stored is not shared with the server on every request. <br />• Information is
        available in multiple windows of the browser(but not if the domain is
        the same) <br />• Storage capacity limit is much larger than 4kb limit for
        cookies <br />• Data does not automatically expire as it does with cookies <br />Web
        socket is a new protocol that allows two-way communication with a server
        also known as push messaging. This means that the client get a response
        as soon as it is received. The notification API allows you to show
        messages using the systems notifications.
