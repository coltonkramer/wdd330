            Testing and debugging
There will always be bugs so we need to learn to deal with them.
Errors:
System error - problem with the system or its interactions
Program error - program contains syntax errors or a typo
User error - user has entered information incorrectly and the program cannot handle it
We should try to reduce errors impact as much as possible. User errors could also be considered developer errors
Stack Traces:
This will trace from where the error occurred back to where the error started
Warnings:
Are errors that arent problematic enough to cause the program to crash. This can cause the program to continue to run incorrectly. 
Even though js often runs through the errors as programmers we should write sound code that catches as many exceptions as possible
Strict mode:
this is a mode that produces more warnings than the normal mode counterpart. Just add use strict; if the engine does not support strict mode this line will simply be ignored.
Linting:
Checks formatting of a document and is often used as a standard for a team so everyone s code looks the same.
Feature Detection:
Used to make sure a feature is supported. Modernizr is a program that can be used for this issue.
Exception Handling:
We can deal with exceptions using a try block. If an error occurs it will throw the catch part of the try block and return what ever you set there.
Tests:
Using test can save time and headache. Using tests we can often prevent problems before they occur.
1.	Write tests(the fail)
2.	Write tests to pass the tests
3.	Refactor the code
4.	Test refactored code
5.	Write more tests for new features
