        Forms are a method of interacting with a webpage. Forms use inputs to store user information and collect data from users. It begins with a <em>form</em> element tag. <br><br>
            Input fields :<br><br>
            Text-<br>
            Default type is text which is used to enter short piece of text such as a username. It 
            isnt required to use type=text attribute but it is recommended so there is no question 
            as to what your input is meant to do. <br><br>
            Password-<br>
            Type password is used for information you dont want others to see, hence password. <br>
            Type=password<br><br>
            Checkboxes-<br>
            Use type checkbox. They are used to check options true or false. Checkboxes with the same 
            name attribute can be accessed as an HTML collection<br><br>
            Radio- <br>
            Type = radio. Similar to the checkboxes where they are either true or false but different in that only one can be selected in at a time.<br><br>
            Hidden-<br>
            Type = hidden. Hidden inputs can still be read by html even though they are not displayed on screen. They can also be accessed through js<br><br>
            Number-<br>

            Text areas-<br>
