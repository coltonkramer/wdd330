        Forms are a method of interacting with a webpage. Forms use inputs to store user information and collect data from users. It begins with a <form> element tag. 
            
            Input fields :
            Text-
            Default type is text which is used to enter short piece of text such as a username. It isnt required to use type=text attribute but it is recommended so there is no question as to what your input is meant to do. 
            Password-
            Type password is used for information you dont want others to see, hence password. 
            Type=password
            Checkboxes-
            Use type checkbox. They are used to check options true or false. Checkboxes with the same name attribute can be accessed as an HTML collection
            Radio- 
            Type = radio. Similar to the checkboxes where they are either true or false but different in that only one can be selected in at a time.
            Hidden-
            Type = hidden. Hidden inputs can still be read by html even though they are not displayed on screen. They can also be accessed through js
            Number-
            Gives a number selecter wheel instead of having to type the number on the keyboard
            Drop down list-
            Takes a list of values from the <option> tags given to it and makes a drop down list
                Text areas-
                Allows the user in input long strings of data into a text box. Uses <textarea></textarea>
                Buttons-
                Gives the user a way to submit the form.
